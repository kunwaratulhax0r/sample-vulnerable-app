  # FIX: Moved AppBucket definition after ReplicationRole to break circular dependency
  # The circular dependency was caused by AppBucket referencing ReplicationRole.Arn (line 15)
  # while ReplicationRole referenced AppBucket.Arn (lines 45, 51)
  
  # IAM role for S3 replication - defined first to avoid circular dependency
